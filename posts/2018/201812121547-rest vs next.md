    :title "Clojure: rest vs next"
}

`next` is stricter than (the new behaviour of) `rest` because it needs to evaluate the structure of the lazy cons to know whether to return `nil` or a seq.

`rest` on the other hand always returns a seq, so nothing needs to be evaluated until you actually use the result of `rest`. In other words, `rest` is more lazy than next.


`next` is like `(seq (rest ...))`.

`rest` will return the remaining piece of a sequence. If that piece of the sequence has not yet been realized, rest doesn't force it. It won't even tell you if there are more elements left in the sequence.

`next` does the same thing but then forces at least one element of the sequence to be realized. So if `next` returns `nil`, you know there aren't any more elements left in the sequence.


`next`会去实例化第一个元素，然后返回第一个实例化元素+剩余序列，如果没有元素了，`next`会告诉你没有剩余元素了，就会返回`nil`

`rest`会返回剩余序列，`rest`不回去实例化序列的任何一个元素，也不会告诉你剩余序列还有没有元素。
